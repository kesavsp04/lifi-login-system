LiFi Based Login System
üåü Project Overview
This project demonstrates a novel approach to secure login systems by leveraging Light Fidelity (LiFi) technology. We've developed a prototype featuring a 3-locker/safe system where each lock can be opened and closed using distinct lock and unlock codes transmitted via modulated light from a smartphone.

The core of the system relies on a custom-built Android application, "Velicham," which modulates the device's flashlight to encode 4-digit login credentials. This modulated light signal is then received by an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) module, which converts the optical data into electrical signals. These signals are processed by a Clone Arduino Uno R3, which interprets the codes and controls one of three SG90 servo motors acting as the physical locks.

A 16x2 LCD display provides real-time feedback on the system's status, guiding the user through the login process and indicating states such as "Waiting for input," "Lock 3 Unlocked," "Wrong Code," "Please Wait," "Timeout," and a "Locked!" state if five incorrect codes are entered.

‚ú® Features
LiFi Communication: Utilizes Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a smartphone flashlight for secure, short-range data transmission.

Three-Tier Security: Implements a three-locker system, each with unique lock/unlock codes.

Custom Android App ("Velicham"): A dedicated application developed with Android Studio for precise light modulation and code transmission.

Real-time User Feedback: An integrated 16x2 LCD connected via an I2C module provides clear status messages during operation.

Robust Error Handling: Features comprehensive error detection including "Wrong Code," "Timeout," and a "Locked!" state after five consecutive failed attempts.

Arduino Control: Logic handled by a cost-effective Clone Arduino Uno R3 platform for accessibility and ease of development.

üí° How It Works
Here are images of the physical prototype and the LCD display in action:

The system operates on a simple, yet effective principle:

Code Transmission (Velicham App): The user enters a 4-digit code into the Velicham Android application. Each digit is converted into a specific flashlight ON duration based on a rule (e.g., 0 = 50ms, 1 = 100ms, ..., 9 = 500ms). The app blinks the flashlight in sequence, with a 50ms OFF gap between each digit.

Light Reception (LDR Module): An LDR module detects these precise flashlight pulses. The varying light intensity changes the LDR's resistance, which is then converted into a digital signal processed by the Arduino.

Data Processing (Arduino Uno R3): The Arduino continuously monitors the LDR's digital output, measuring the ON durations. It then maps these durations back to the corresponding digits, reconstructing the original 4-digit code.

Lock Control (Servo Motors): Based on the decoded code, the Arduino verifies it against pre-defined authentication keys. If the code is correct, the corresponding SG90 servo motor rotates 180 degrees to an "unlocked" position. After a predefined time (e.g., 5 seconds), the servo returns to its locked position (0 degrees).

Status Display (LCD): The 16x2 LCD connected to the Arduino provides immediate visual feedback, displaying messages like "Waiting for Input," "Access Granted - Safe Unlocked," "Access Denied - Invalid Code," "Timeout," and the "Locked! Wait Xs" message during temporary lockouts.

Security Measures: The system includes logic to increment a counter for wrong code entries. If 5 incorrect codes are entered consecutively, the system enters a temporary lockout state (e.g., 30 seconds) to prevent brute-force attacks.
